description: |-
  The application of deep learning techniques using convolutional neural
  networks to the classification of particle collisions in High Energy
  Physics is explored.
  An intuitive approach to transform physical variables, like momenta of
  particles and jets, into a single image that captures the relevant information,
  is proposed. The idea is tested using a well known deep learning framework on
  a simulation dataset, including leptonic ttbar events and the corresponding
  background at 7 TeV from the CMS experiment at LHC, available as Open Data.
  This initial test shows competitive results when compared to more classical
  approaches, like those using feedforward neural networks.
