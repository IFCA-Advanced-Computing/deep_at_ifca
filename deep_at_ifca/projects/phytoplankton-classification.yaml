description: |-
  We trained an image classifier to identify phytoplankton in
  collaboration with the Vlaams Instituut voor de Zee.

  As training dataset we have used a collection of images from
  the Spanish Royal Botanical Garden which consists of around
  28K images from 743 species and 493 genera.
