  This usecase intends to link large-scale atmospheric variables with the local
  variables of interest relying on a record of historical observations to have
  fine-grained meteorological predictions.
  This work is developed in collaboration with the Meteorology group of the Institute of Physics of Cantabria.

  The global circulation models (GCM) are the main tools used to study the
  evolution of climate at different time scales. These solve numerically the
  differential equations governing the climate system discretising in both
  space and time. Due to some intrinsic limitations (e.g., computational resources)
  the spatial resolution of these models is very coarse limiting their applicability
  in local-data dependent communities (e.g., energy). To address this issue, statistical
  downscaling aims to link large-scale atmospheric variables (predictors) with the local
  variables of interest (predictands) relying on a record of historical observations.

  The dataset consists of daily atmospheric data from the year 1979 to 2008, selected
  from the ERA-Interim and EWEMBI predictor and predictand datasets, respectively.
  The spatial domain ranges from -10 to 30 in longitude and from 34 to 74 in latitude.
