  We trained an image classifier to identify conus marine snails at species level.
  
  The training dataset has been provided by the Natural Science Museum of Madrid and it consists of a dataset containing images of 68 species of conus covering three different regions: the Panamic region; the South African region; and the Western Atlantic and Mediterranean region.
