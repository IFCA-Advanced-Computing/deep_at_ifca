  The aim improve classification speed and accuracy of chest X-ray images. In the current state of health alarm,
  due to the saturation of the medical systems, professionals with no x-ray experience are being forced to interpret
  the chest images. Under these circumstances, a reliable automatic triage system to assist diagnosis is needed.
  The developed tools will be equally applicable to other diseases with pneumonia.
  The training dataset will be composed of patient X-ray images available from the hospital Marqu√©s de Valdecilla.
