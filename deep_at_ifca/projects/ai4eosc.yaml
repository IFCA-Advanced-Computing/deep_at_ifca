  AI4EOSC (Artificial Intelligence for the European Open Science Cloud) delivers an enhanced 
  set of advanced services for the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) 
  and Deep Learning (DL) models and applications in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). These services 
  are bundled together into a comprehensive platform providing advanced features such as distributed, 
  federated and split learning; novel provenance metadata for AI/ML/DL models; event-driven data processing 
  services or provisioning of AI/ML/DL services based on serverless computing. 
  
  The project builds on top of the [Deep Hybrid Datacloud](https://deep.ifca.es/projects/deephdc) project
  and the EOSC compute platform and services in order to provide this specialized compute platform.
