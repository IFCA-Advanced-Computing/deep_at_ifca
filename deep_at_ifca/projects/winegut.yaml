description: |-
  We want to understand the relation between wine consumption and the risk of developing alzheimer.
  For this we are developing a neural network to automatically detect and measure wine in glasses.
  The network will be first trained first with lab-controlled images, and then will be fine-tuned to
  classify images in real-world scenarios, with data submitted from interested users.
