description: |-
  The final goal of the project is to prepare a new generation of
  e-infrastructures that harness latest generation technologies,
  supporting deep learning and other intensive computing techniques
  to exploit very large data sources. The project will provide the
  corresponding services to lower the adoption barriers for new communities
  and users, satisfying the needs of both research, education communities and citizen science.
