  The goal is perform a comprehensive study of data anonymization techniques. We present the implementation of the Python library [pyCANON](https://github.com/IFCA/pycanon), which can be used to check the level of anonymity of a dataset by means of the most common privacy-preserving techniques (see the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07556)). The next objective is the implementation of different techniques to achieve the level of anonymity required, and the study of techniques such as differential privacy.
