  The goal is to perform a comprehensive study of data anonymization techniques.
  We present the implementation of the Python library [pyCANON](https://github.com/IFCA/pycanon),
  which can be used to check the level of anonymity of a dataset by means of the most common privacy-preserving
  techniques (see the related [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01894-2)). In addition, we are working 
  in the analysis of the impact of anonymization in the performance of different machine learning models (see the following
  [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07415)). We are also working in the implementation of different techniques 
  to achieve the level of anonymity required by the users by means of a Python library.
