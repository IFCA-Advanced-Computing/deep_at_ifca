description: |-
  Federated learning is a data decentralization privacy-preserving technique used to perform
  machine or deep learning in a secure way.
  
  The main goal is to study the implementation of different schemas for decentralized
  machine/deep learning (from federated learning to gossip learning, split learning, etc).
  In addition, we are interested in studying different use cases of the application of these
  techniques as well as open problems in the field of federated learning.
  
  This work is part of the [AI4EOSC](https://deep.ifca.es/projects/ai4eosc) project.
