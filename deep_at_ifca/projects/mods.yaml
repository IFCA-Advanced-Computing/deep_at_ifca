description: |-
  This project intends to improve classical Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
  using Deep Learning tools.
  
  The idea is to be able to filter the massive amounts of alerts generated by traditional
  IDS (eg. Snort) in order to provide a more curated and relevant subset that can be analyzed
  by network supervisors.
  
  An initial implementation was carried out during the DEEP Hybrid DataCloud project under the
  Massive Online Data Streams (MODS) usecase.
