description: |-
  The work deals with a proactive network monitoring for security and protection
  of computing infrastructures. We provide an exploitation of an intelligent module,
  in the form of a as a machine learning application using deep learning modeling,
  in order to enhance functionality of intrusion detection system supervising
  network traffic flows. Currently, intrusion detection systems work well for
  network monitoring in near real-time and they effectively deal with threats
  in a reactive way. Deep learning is the emerging generation of artificial
  intelligence techniques and one of the most promising candidates for intelligence
  integration into traditional solutions leading to quality improvement of the
  original solutions. The work presented in this paper faces the challenge of
  cooperation between deep learning techniques and large-scale data processing.
  The outcomes obtained from extensive and careful experiments show the applicability
  and feasibility of simultaneously modelled multiple monitoring channels using
  deep learning techniques. The proper joining of deep learning modelling with
  scalable data preprocessing ensures high quality and stability of model performance
  in dynamic and fast-changing environments such as network traffic flow monitoring.
